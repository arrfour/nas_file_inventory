## Version

This is version 0.2 of the File Inventory Application.

## Overview

The **File Inventory Application** is a Python-based tool designed to scan directories, extract metadata about files, and display useful insights in a visually appealing terminal interface. The app features:

- **File Metadata Extraction**: Collects details such as file name, size, extension, and last modified date.
- **Interactive Menus**: Allows users to navigate through options like summary statistics, file searches, and grouping by directory.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Displays total files, total size, size by drive, most recent file, and last scan timestamp.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Supports customizable color palettes via a JSON configuration file for a flexible and user-defined UI.

## Features

- **Scan Directories**: Traverse directories and extract metadata for all files.
- **Display Inventory**: View file statistics, search files, filter by extension, and more.
- **Persistent Data**: Saves inventory data to a JSON file for future use.
- **Last Scan Tracking**: Records and displays the timestamp of the most recent scan.
- **Customizable Colors**: Modify the UI theme by editing the `colors.json` file.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `tqdm`: For progress bars during file scanning.
  - `colorama`: For terminal color enhancements.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install tqdm colorama
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the directories you want to scan.

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python extract_metadata.py
   ```

2. Follow the interactive menus to:
   - Scan directories and update the inventory.
   - View file inventory statistics and details.
   - Search, filter, or group files.
   - Customize the UI theme by editing the `colors.json` file.
3. Exit the application by selecting the `x` option in any menu.

## Assumptions

- The application dynamically determines the default source folder based on the current user's home directory. For example, it defaults to `~/OneDrive/Documents` on systems where OneDrive is configured.
- The application assumes the user has access to the directories they want to scan.
- The application is designed for Windows but can be adapted for other operating systems.

## File Structure

- `extract_metadata.py`: Main application script.
- `file_inventory.json`: Stores the scanned file inventory data.
- `last_scan.json`: Tracks the timestamp of the most recent scan.
- `colors.json`: Defines the color palette for the application's UI.
